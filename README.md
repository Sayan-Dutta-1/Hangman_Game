# Hangman_Game
This is a visual implementation of the classic Hangman Game

Here are the basic rules for a user vs. program hangman game:

The program will think of a word and the user will try to guess the word by suggesting letters.
For each letter that is not in the word, the program will draw a part of a hangman's gallows.
If the user correctly guesses a letter that is in the word, the program will fill in the corresponding letter in the word and give the user another chance to guess.
The game continues until the user either correctly guesses the word or the hangman is complete and the user is "hanged."
